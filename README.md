# Install Node.js dependencies
yarn

# Compile TypeScript

# Run
yarn start
```

## Available scripts

## Building from Docker

### Easiest start

To start Subsocial offchain storage separately (you should have docker-compose):

```
cd docker/
./compose.sh
```

It will start 3 containers: postgres, elasticsearch and offchain itself.

### Start all parts of Subsocial at once with [Subsocial-Starter](https://github.com/dappforce/dappforce-subsocial-starter)
